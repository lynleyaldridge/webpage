This is the GitHub repository linked to my personal blog/portfolio.

It's made using GitHub, the blogdown package in RStudio, and the Academic theme for Hugo.  And it's deployed using Netlify at https://lynleyaldridge.netlify.app/.

It's still a work in progress, but I've created an initial post, as well as creating and linking initial project and publication pages as a proof of concept.

A post on how I got it up and running is forthcoming.
