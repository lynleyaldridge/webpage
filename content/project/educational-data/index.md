I am currently using the [Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth (LSAY)](https://www.lsay.edu.au/) and [Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/) data, plus various data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, to build my skills and experience visualizing, analysing and reporting on educational data using R. This includes conducting and reporting on factor analysis and multilevel regression analysis using R (and related packages). Work in progress will be shared on this project page (e.g., see publications listed below).
