I am a PhD qualified social scientist, with a background in psychology and sociology. I love data analysis, visualization and interpretation, and have coordinated a variety of  quantitative and qualitative research and evaluation projects to successful completion in the fields of psycho-oncology and education. I am passionate about the use of data to inform practice and advocacy. I call myself an Antipodean, as someone who has  been fortunate to enjoy many interludes of working, studying and living abroad, who identifies as equal parts Kiwi (New Zealander) and Aussie (Australian).
