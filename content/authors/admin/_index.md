I am a PhD qualified social scientist, with a background in psychology and sociology. I love data analysis, visualization and interpretation, and have rich experience collecting, managing, analysing and reporting on both quantitative and qualitative data across a diverse range of research and evaluation projects (primarily in the fields of psycho-oncology and education). I am passionate about the use of data to inform policy and practice. I call myself an Antipodean, identifying as equal parts Kiwi (New Zealander) and Aussie (Australian). 

I'm currently searching for a Research and/or Evaluation job (primarily focusing on the education and mental health/well-being sectors). I'm open to working remotely, or positions across Australia.
