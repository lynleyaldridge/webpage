In this post I talk through, step-by-step, the process I used to create this website. There are already plenty of great resources online that will talk you through this process, but this is written by a relative novice to both R and GitHub, in the hopes that my experiences will be of use to others in similar situations. 

If you’re a relatively experienced user of R, I’d recommend consulting one of these great sources:

* blogdown
* Alison Hill's [Up and Running with Blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/)

These step-by-step guides were an essential reference for me, and were really good at pointing me to all the additional resources I needed to work through the process of setting up this blog. However, I did need to do a lot of preparatory work using these resources to understand what I was doing at each stage and why. More importantly, I had to identify what the options were that I was choosing between, in order to make this blog one that would fulfill the goals I had for it. So I’ve provided a more detailed description of my process below.

## Step 1: Initital confusion

Word cloud made using WordClouds.com. Add Git Bash Shell?

First, let’s talk about the initial confusion I experienced when I sat down to figure out what exactly I wanted to do, and what I needed to learn or put in place to get to the end result that is this blog. I read through the above resources a few times, and took some notes.  What are all these things I’ve never heard of before?  More importantly, how do they relate to each other?  Do some of them cluster together? Are there decisions that I should make about which route I want to go down before I go any further?

Reading and re-reading a lot of different descriptions of setting up online blogs and portfolios, I was able to identify a number of different paths I could take, that I would need to choose between.

1. Using GitHub, blogdown and Hugo, with Netlify to host

This is the process that [Alison Hill](), [Kristy Robledo](), [Rebecca Barter]() and others have gone down.

2. Using GitHub alone

3. Using distill 

## Step 2: Decision points?



## Step 3: Summary process

# Step 4: Getting acquainted with GitHub

# Step 5: Creating a new site using blogdown 

# Step 6: Making inital changes to configurations

# Step 7: Testing deployment (push to GitHub and deploy via Netlify)

# Step 8: Troubleshooting

# Step 9: Settling in for the long haul - additional configuration changes
