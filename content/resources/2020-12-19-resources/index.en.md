This page is a work in progress, on which I'm going to list and categorize resources I've found useful in my journey to use R.

## Starting out
I began my R journey in June 2020, by working through the [RStudio primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) and the wonderful [RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/) course created by [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/). These gave me a solid foundation in the basics and confidence to begin exploring on my own. 

## Reference
Here are some books I have found useful in continuing my journey:

* [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund
* [Data science in education using R](https://datascienceineducation.com/) by Ryan Estrellado, Emily Bovee, Jesse Mostipak, Joshua Rosenberg and Isabella Vel&#225;squez

## Multilevel modelling
I've begun working through the Centre for Multilevel Modelling's [LEMMA course](https://www.cmm.bris.ac.uk/lemma/course/) (Learning Environment for Multilevel Methodology and Applications). The Centre for Multilevel Modelling is based at the University of Bristol in the UK, and this fabulous resource is free to use with registration. The course begins with a refresher in introductory statistics and multiple regression, and progresses to worked examples of increasingly complex multilevel models, with worked examples in R (and other packages) and quizzes to test understanding as you progress.
